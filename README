------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this directory, you can find programs in C++ to solve route pickup and 
delivery problem. By branch and bound and heuristics

========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Instalation of LEMON package
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The LEMON Graph Library can be found in the link:
	http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/

	Follow instalation guide 
	just note to use:
	
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your-path-here/pickup_delivery/lemon ..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. Instalation of Graphviz
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package used to build pdf files to view graphs, is the graphviz package
that can be obtained from the link

http://www.graphviz.org/

You can also install via brew or macports (mac users).
When this package is installed, you can use two programs that are used
to transform a graph in the .dot format to a pdf format. These are the
"dot" and the "neato" programs.
To test if you have access to, say neato, execute the following command
in a terminal:

neato -V

With this command you can see the version of the neato program. E.g.,
"neato - graphviz version X.XX.X"
where X.XX.X is the graphviz version number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Correcting the pdf reader.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As some of the programs in this directory uses a pdf reader, you have to change
the name of the program that is used to view pdf files. 

To change the pdf viewer for each program, you can use the command
set_pdfreader   to change the pdf viewer for that program.

For example, in the program ex_pickup_delivery.cpp you can find the following lines commented:

  //set_pdfreader("open");    // pdf reader for Mac OS X
  //set_pdfreader("xpdf");    // pdf reader for Linux
  //set_pdfreader("evince");  // pdf reader for Linux

Uncomment one of the above lines (remove the first "//") to use the
corresponding pdf viewer. Of course, you must have the pdf viewer 
installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Building the executable files in this directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, you have to change the Makefile with the correct paths.
Basically, you must change two lines with the attribution of the following vars:

LEMONDIR = ....

if you followed step 2. just do:
LEMONDIR = ./lemon 


The makefile uses a command "ar" to generate a lib called "mylib.a" from
the obj files: mygraphlib.o geompack.o myutils.o mycolor.o
You can use other commands to generate such lib (in some systems, there is the command libtool) or you can change the 
makefile to use the obj files  mygraphlib.o geompack.o myutils.o  directly without doing the lib file.

Finally, you have to do the following command in the main folder:

make

The executable files have suffix ".e"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Testing the programs
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To test any of the following programs, you only need to run the program, without
any parameters. To see what they do, see the corresponding .cpp file.
Example:

./bin/ex_pickup_delivery.e          (Solves pickup and delivery problems)

The program ex_pickup_delivery has a filename as argument. For example,

./bin/ex_tsp.e   ./instances/pickup_delivery_5.dig	10
													

Since this program is for didactical purposes it is very limited and is not
optimized.
